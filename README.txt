 In order to run the application, the required modules are need to be installed via npm.

On command prompt, go to the root directory and run "npm install" to install the modules.

After the modules are installed run "npm start" to start the application. 

Browse to http://localhost:8080/ to see the weather forecast page.

Note: I would have liked to add the following to the solution if I had more time

1. Refactored WeatherUI.js by decomposing the weather details section of it into WeatherEachDay component.

2. Add unit tests in detail to test rendering and interactivity.

3. Looked further into the data displayed.

4. Add jquery as a module for Bootstrap to work.
