 In order to run the application, the required modules are needed to be installed via npm.

Run "npm install" to install the modules in the root folder.

Run "npm start" to start the application. 

Browse to http://localhost:8080/ to see the weather forecast page pulling data from a weather API.

Note: I would have liked to add unit tests in detail to test rendering of each component.
